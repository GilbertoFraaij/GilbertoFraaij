👋 Hello, my name is Gilberto.

I know it sounds very Spanish/Latin, but don't be fooled. I am from the beautiful island of Curaçao. But yes, I speak Spanish. I have spent over half of my lifetime living in the Netherlands, where I studied Software Engineering.

Decided to head back to where the sun shines all year round – maybe permanently, or perhaps I'll find myself missing the hustle and bustle of big cities where you can snag any tech your heart desires.

Since my teen years, I've been captivated by the world of computers and the art of coding. Sure, I wish I could've started earlier, but back then, the cash flow wasn't exactly overflowing. So, I kicked off my coding journey a bit later. But you know what? I relished every moment, and guess what? I still do.

There's something about tinkering with my little projects that might seem a tad peculiar to others. I mean, who cares if I'm not raking in the big bucks? If I fancy creating my own IRC server in .Net and whipping up a Twitch-like platform just for kicks, well, why the heck not? Cheers to coding for the sheer joy of it! 🚀💻

Beyond all that, I have a soft spot for assisting others on their coding odyssey. If I'm well-versed in the topic, consider me your coding superhero – I'll swoop in and help you untangle those stubborn problems. I'll confess to a little quirk of mine: when someone throws a coding SOS my way, I might just temporarily shelve my own pet projects to lend a hand. Hey, we all have our quirks, right? Helping others just happens to be one of mine. 🦸‍♂️💻
